# Car-Industry-Data-Warehouse-and-Data-Mining
This project is about the Car Industry that sells and services (repairs) the cars. We built a sample data Warehouse in MS Visual Studio, imported the data, clean and refined it, and processed it for data mining techniques to get fruitful results. These three business processes are handled by the three systems:

Car Sales Module.
Car Service Center.
Car Parts Suppliers.

The management wants to build a data warehouse based on these three source systems for the purpose of better business understanding and increasing business profit for their industry.
Abstraction of Possible Queries 

Which car is on demand the most?
How many customers bought a particular car?
Which car features are most preferred by customers?
Which manufacture cars mostly came for service?
Which mechanic resolved cars issues the most?
Which is the most demanding car part?
Which car model part is most demanding?
Who are most valuable car parts suppliers?

PHASE-I
Integrated ER Model of Target DW 
Dimensional Models of Data Marts 
Your design shall be complete in all respects including the domain, entity integrity and referential integrity constraints. All models shall be designed using ERWIN or Fat Free Star Tool. You will also have to implement your data model in SQL SERVER.

PHASE-II
Design the extraction strategy for your data warehouse
Design the transformation strategy for your data warehouse
Design the loading strategy for your data warehouse
Implementation of ETL using MS Business Intelligence studio.
    
PHASE-III
Design the indexing strategy for your data warehouse. Determine which indexes are to be used on which columns of the table. Determine scenarios in which indexes will be helpful and what will be the costs associated. Some aspects of implementation of indexes and table joining techniques will also be required. 

How many cars are sold and required parts in 1st year ?
Monthly/Quarterly/Yearly expense on car service and maintenance (including parts)
How many car parts are required by Male and Female Customers ? (Yearly). You would have to add Gender Field in all three source databases. 

TRANSFORMATIONS
Separate First Name and Last Name 
Male/Female 
Use Different Date Formats in all three source systems and transform them into one format for target DW
